    "# read count scatter\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python 3 program takes two sample files (tsv) and a base name for the output .pdf file, and returns a file (.pdf) containing a scatterplot of the readcounts for Sample A and Sample B.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This program was developed to the specifications of the Program B assignment for Special Topic paper 247.782, 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* [SciPy Stack 1.0](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)\n",
    "* [StatsModels 0.9.0](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/install.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clone\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/annabehling/program_B`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic usage of the program is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "./read_count_scatter.py sample_a sample_b scatter_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which produces a file:\n",
    "`test.pdf`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform a test run of read_count_scatter.py using the example data files `sampleA.txt` and `sampleB.txt` provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "./read_count_scatter.py sampleA.txt sampleB.txt test\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where `sampleA.txt` and `sampleB.txt` are tsv files with two colums **and headings for each column**.  \n",
    "The first column contains the gene names from the sample and the second column contains the readcount values for each gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of `sampleA.txt` looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "gene\tsampleA\n",
    "EfM3.000010\t21\n",
    "EfM3.000020\t63\n",
    "EfM3.000030\t42\n",
    "EfM3.000040\t8\n",
    "EfM3.000050\t206\n",
    "EfM3.000060\t202\n",
    "EfM3.000070\t129\n",
    "EfM3.000080\t89\n",
    "EfM3.000090\t11\n",
    "EfM3.000100\t326\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of `sampleB.txt` looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "gene\tsampleB\n",
    "EfM3.000010\t8\n",
    "EfM3.000020\t14\n",
    "EfM3.000030\t7\n",
    "EfM3.000040\t3\n",
    "EfM3.000050\t41\n",
    "EfM3.000060\t77\n",
    "EfM3.000070\t96\n",
    "EfM3.000080\t55\n",
    "EfM3.000090\t5\n",
    "EfM3.000100\t115\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And where `test` is the base name (str) for the .pdf file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your output file should be `test.pdf`, which has also been provided as an example file.\n",
    "![Image of output PDF](test.png \"test.pdf\")\n",
    "\n",
    "`test.pdf` is a .pdf file containing a scatterplot of the readcounts for Sample A and Sample B.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The x and y axes of the scatterplot have been hardcoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample A** corresponds to the first file parsed to the command line, in this example `sampleA.txt`  \n",
    "**Sample B** corresponds to the second file parsed to the command line, in this example `sampleB.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "The points on the scatterplot (genes) are colour-coded for statistical significance of readcount difference.   \n",
    "p=0.05, adjusted for multiple testing using FDR Benjamini-Hochberg.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "If the program usage is not followed, the program will return specific warnings and error messages.  \n",
    "These will catch the errors in the example data file `sampleBprime.txt` when running:\n",
    "```\n",
    "./read_count_scatter.py sampleA.txt sampleBprime.txt test\n",
    "```\n",
    "No `test.pdf` file will be created. Instead, an error message will be returned:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Gene EfM3.000730 has invalid readcount value: \"bob\". Fatal error, no output written.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The list of errors in `sampleBprime.txt` are:\n",
    "1. `EfM3.000510\t1e8` The code will convert 1e8 to a float and proceed without an error\n",
    "2. `EfM3.000730\tbob` Returns a fatal error (overrides all warning messages)\n",
    "3. `EfM3.blimey\t74`  Returns a warning message\n",
    "4. `EfM3.000010\t8`   The ordering of gene names in each of the sample files is irrelevant due to the missing_genes() function \n",
